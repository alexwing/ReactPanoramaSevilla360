Conversion of a 360ยบ photo from the photographs taken by Jean Laurent, the French photographer based in Spain who took 7 snapshots to form a large panorama of the river and its surroundings.

Jean Laurent was a French photographer who settled in Spain in 1843. In 1856, Laurent opened a studio in Madrid, which became one of the most important in the city. Laurent was one of the first photographers to use the stereoscopic technique in Spain. Laurent was one of the most prolific photographers in Spain in the 19th century. His work covers a wide range of subjects, including portraits, cityscapes and landscapes, and photographs of architecture and art. Laurent was one of the first photographers to document Spain's architecture and landscape, and his work is an important source for studying 19th-century Spanish history and culture.

Regarding this panorama, the French photographer took 7 snapshots to form a large panorama of the river and its surroundings. The original photos were taken in 1886 and show a panoramic view of the city from the Guadalquivir River, taken from the current Betis Street, probably from the roof or terrace of a house. It includes the ships in the port, the buildings and streets of the city, and the surrounding landscape. The exposure time of the photograph was very long, so, for example, we see a person in two positions: looking at the photographer and contemplating the river. This gives the sensation of seeing a ghostly figure. It is a fabulous journey into the past.

To stitch the photos together and form the panorama, surprisingly the images were perfectly aligned, so no adjustments were necessary, only the removal of imperfections, dust, and scratches that existed in the original photos. Jean Laurent was an exceptional photographer, and his photos were taken with great precision.

To colorize the photo, it was divided into small sections and colored using different artificial intelligence tools. The sections were then joined to form the final image, the colors were adjusted to be more realistic, and a believable sky was added.

For the bottom part, different artificial intelligence tools were used. First, rough sketches were made and then passed through various AI programs multiple times to make them more realistic. Then, super-resolution was applied to achieve higher quality.
