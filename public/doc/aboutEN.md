Conversion of a 360º photo from pictures taken by Jean Laurent, the French photographer who lived in Spain and took 7 snapshots to form a large panorama of the river and its surroundings.

Jean Laurent was a French photographer who settled in Spain in 1843. In 1856, Laurent opened a studio in Madrid, which became one of the most important in the city. Laurent was one of the first photographers to use the stereoscope technique in Spain. He was one of the most prolific photographers in Spain in the 19th century. His work covers a wide range of subjects, including portraits, city and landscape views, and photographs of architecture and art. Laurent was one of the first photographers to document Spain's architecture and landscape, and his work is an important source for the study of 19th-century Spanish history and culture.

Regarding this panorama, the French photographer took 7 snapshots to form a large panorama of the river and its surroundings. The original photos were taken in 1886 and show a panoramic view of the city from the Guadalquivir River taken from the current Betis Street, probably from the roof or terrace of a house. It includes the ships in the port, the buildings and streets of the city, and the surrounding landscape. The exposure time of the photograph was very long, so we see a person in two positions: looking at the photographer and gazing at the river. This gives the impression of seeing a ghostly image. It is a fabulous journey into the past.

To stitch the photos together and form the panorama, surprisingly the images were correctly aligned, so not many adjustments were needed, only removing imperfections, dust, and scratches that existed in the original photos. Jean Laurent was an exceptional photographer, and his photos were taken with great precision. However, to be honest, the final version I am using is not the one I stitched together, but a version provided by Javier Marquéz, a colleague from when I worked at Cyan Animatica. He had already stitched the photos and removed the imperfections from a higher quality version than the one I had.

To colorize the photo, it was divided into small sections and colored using different artificial intelligence tools. Then they were stitched together to form the final image, some parts were manually adjusted and colored, and a believable sky was added. Some of these tools include palette.fm, hotpot.ai, and 9may.mail.ru/restoration.

For the lower part, different artificial intelligence tools were used: freepick (upscaler, reimagine) and magnific.ai. First, rough sketches were made and then passed several times through different AI programs to make them more realistic. Then super-resolution was applied to achieve higher quality. It should be noted that this recreation of the lower part is an interpretation that might not be accurate. The two images below are views of Betis Street from the same period. I tried to give it a similar appearance, but it should not be taken as a realistic representation.
